# Partitioning error of transcription factors at cell division

This repository contains my report and MATLAB scaffolding for simulations/analysis of
transcription factor partitioning noise at cell division (e.g., equal, binomial, and
chromosome hitch-hiking models).

## What’s inside
- `docs/Report(2nd Project).pdf` — full project report
- `matlab/` — **put your MATLAB `.m` scripts here**
- `data/` — **put your `.mat` data files here**

## Quick start (MATLAB)
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place your `.m` files into `matlab/` and your `.mat` files into `data/`.
3. In MATLAB, add this folder to the path and run your main script (e.g., `Mysimulation.m`).

## Notes
- Consider using **Git LFS** for large `.mat` files to keep the repo fast:
  ```bash
  git lfs install
  git lfs track "*.mat"
  git add .gitattributes
  git commit -m "Track .mat files with Git LFS"
  ```
